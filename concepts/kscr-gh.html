<p class="scrollParagraph">The Kumasi Cancer Registry (KsCR) was established in 2004 as a hospital-based cancer registry with the aim of identifying cases of cancer seen at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH). KATH is one of the three teaching hospitals in Ghana and it is based in Kumasi, the second largest city in the country. At inception, the registry focussed on data collected from the National Centre for Nuclear and Radiation Medicine/Directorate of Oncology of KATH. Data collection was extended to include other clinical departments subsequently. The Pathology department of the hospital was not well equipped to make pathological diagnosis due to inadequate human resource and equipment. Diagnosis and management of cancers were largely based on clinical presentation with histology and other laboratory-based tests accounting for a smaller proportion of cases of cancers seen in KATH. Over the past five years, the Pathology Department has seen a remarkable improvement in the human resource situation with competent staff presently available to improve the quality of diagnosis and management of cases of cancer. The African Cancer Registry Network (AFCRN) conducted a familiarisation visit to the Kumasi Cancer Registry in 2012 with recommendation for the registry to be a population-based one. This culminated in the training of the Registry Manager in Malawi in July the same year in an AFCRN sponsored workshop. The Registry is currently established as a population-based one with abstraction of cases of cancers seen in 2012 completed and those for 2013 still ongoing. The reference population for the Registry is the city of Kumasi as designated by the 2010 Ghana Population and Housing Census. The designation â€˜Kumasiâ€™ as recorded by the Ghana Statistical Service including all localities as designated by the 2000 census will be maintained irrespective of the political re-demarcations that may follow subsequent censuses. This is to ensure consistency with the reference population.</p>
