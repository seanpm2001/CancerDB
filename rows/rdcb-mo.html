The registry occupies an office in the department of pathology, within the Hospital Central (Clinical Director: Dr Elvira Xavier and General Director: Augusto CÃ©sar Macome).

Beira district comprises 23 bairros. The data are being entered using simple EXCEL spreadsheets, one for each year. Several items â€“ for example, place of residence, source of information, are entered as abbreviations (Annex 2). There are no quality control procedures, or duplicate checks performed. The registry prepares an internal report each year. The great majority of patients are included in the registry with basis of diagnosis histology or cytology.
